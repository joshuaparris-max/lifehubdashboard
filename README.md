# LifeHub Structure

This folder is the single hub for everything outside of system-managed folders (Desktop, Downloads, etc.). Use the numbered areas below as the only places to look when you need to file or find something:

- **Inbox** – temporary landing zone for anything you have not categorised yet. Empty weekly.
- **Work** – employment history, contracts, job search materials, professional development certificates.
- **Family** – medical, school, therapy and support information for the family.
- **Finance** – insurance policies, bank statements, invoices and tax items.
- **Housing** – rentals, property paperwork, moving checklists.
- **Personal** – admin IDs, planning docs, wellbeing/fitness tracking.
- **Projects** – active build/code/design work. Tools for projects live under `Projects/Software/Tools`.
- **Hobbies** – games, tabletop campaigns, modding tools.
- **Media** – photos, screenshots, creative assets.
- **Templates** – boilerplate files you want to reuse.
- **Resources** – general reference docs that do not belong to a single project or year.
- **Archive/YYYY** – material that is done/closed out but needs to be kept. Store per year so the active areas stay lean.

## Filing rules
1. Start every week by sweeping `~/Downloads` into `LifeHub/Inbox`, then file from there.
2. If a file belongs to more than one area, store it once and add macOS tags (e.g. "Finance", "Health") for cross-cutting topics.
3. Move finished work to the relevant `Archive/<year>` folder at the end of each quarter.
4. Keep a short `README.md` or `index.md` inside big subfolders (Housing, Projects, etc.) so you remember the conventions for that area.
5. Back up the entire `LifeHub` folder with Time Machine or your sync service so this structure stays intact across devices.
